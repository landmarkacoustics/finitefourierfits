#' Fit a Finite Fourier Basis to Data
#'
#' Sometimes there seems to be a clear functional relationship between two
#' variables in a data set, but it is poorly approximated by polynomials. A
#' Fourier basis may be able to help. It is, basically, a linear combination
#' of harmonically-related, phase-shifted, weighted cosine curves. This package
#' uses a very simple-minded approach to finding a basis with few curves.
